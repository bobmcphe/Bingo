Bingo
-----
Working my way through an old copy of JavaScript Visual Quickstart  by Tom Negrino and Dori Smith.  
Game loads a table, and sets out some arrays of unique random numbers within the correct range. 
Sets a newCard function. During play I toogle the cell color to indicate it was picked.  
I still need to  create a side ball  number caller, that will call out random numbers that you can play. 

Future Plans
I kind of want it to create an array of numbers called, written out along the bottom, and by the time it could have filled your bingo card... will pull a random function to see if "someone else" wins before you or not.
